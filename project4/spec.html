	<h1>CS142 Project 4: Page Generation with ReactJS</h1>
	<h4 class="text-muted">Due: Thursday, May 2, 2019 at 11:59 PM</h4>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Setup</h3>
		<p>
			You should already have installed Node.js and the npm package manager your system.
			If not, follow the <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a> now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Create a directory <code>project4</code> and extract the contents of <a href="downloads/project4react.zip">
			this zip file</a> into the directory. The zip file contains the starter files for this assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This assignment requires many node modules the contains the tools
			(e.g. <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>,
			 <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>,
			 <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>) needed to build a
			 <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> web application as well as
			 a simple Node.js web server (<a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>)
			 to serve it to your browser. These modules can be fetch by
			 running the following command in the <code>project4</code> directory:
			 <pre>npm install</pre>
			 The command will fetch around 600 node modules using around
			 110 megabytes of space into the subdirectory <code>node_modules</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can use npm to run the various tools we had it fetch. As can be
			seen in the "scripts" property of the <code>package.json</code> file, the
			following run commands are availble:
			<ul>
				<li><code>npm run lint</code> - Runs ESLint on all the project's
					JavaScript files. The code you submit should run EShint without
					warnings.
				</li>
				<li><code>npm run build</code> - Runs
					<a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> using the configuration
					file <code>webpack.config.js</code> to package all of the projects
					JSX files into a single JavaScipt bundle in the directory
					<code>compiled</code>.
				</li>
				<li><code>npm run build:w</code> - Runs
					<a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> like the "run build"
					command except it invokes webpack
					with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#watch-options">--watch</a> so
					it will monitor the React components and regenerates the bundle if any
					of them change. This option is useful for development so changes made
					to components can be picked up by simply refreshing the browser to
					load the newly updated bundle. Otherwise you need to remember to
					run "npm run build" after every change.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Your solutions for all of the problems below should be implemented in the <code>project4</code> directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, a
			popular framework for building web applications. The project's goal
			is to get you enough up to speed with ReactJS and the cs142's coding
			conventions that you
			will be able to build a web application with it in the next project.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In order to fetch our web app via the HTTP protocol, we use a simple Node.js
			web server that can be started with the command from the <code>project4</code> directory:
			<pre>node webServer.js</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			All the files in the <code>project4</code> can be fetched using an URL starting with
			<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.  Click on
			<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to verify your
			web server is running. It should serve the file <code>index.html</code> to your browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			We recommend you configure you development environment to run webpack in watch mode so you
			will need to run the node web server and webpack when building and testing your project. You
			could do this by running the programs in different command line windows.  Syntax errors
			get detected and reported by Babel so the output of webpack is useful.  If you are running
			on a system with a unix-like shell like MacOS.  The command:
			<pre>node webServer.js & npm run build:w</pre>
			runs the web server in background and the webpack in forground within a single window.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Getting Started</h3>
		<p>
			In this project we require that you use the model, view, controller pattern described in class.
			There are many ways of organizing code under this pattern so we provide an example that both
			demonstrates some basic ReactJS features as well as showing the file system layout and module
			pattern we would like you to follow in your projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should start by opening the example in your browser by navigating to the URL
			<a href="http://localhost:3000/getting-started.html">http://localhost:3000/getting-started.html</a>.
			The page displays examples of ReactJS in action.  The HTML in <code>getting-started.html</code> provides
			a div for ReactJS to draw the app into and a script tag include the app's JavaScript bundle
			<code>compiled/gettingStarted.bundle.js</code>. The webpack config
			file <code><a href="http://localhost:3000/webpack.config.js">webpack.config.js</a></code>
			directs that this bundle be created from the ReactJS file <code>gettingStarted.jsx</code>, a JSX
			program that renders the ReactJS component named <code>Example</code> into the div in getting-started.html.
		</p>
		<p>
			To support reusable components, we adopt a file organization that co-locates the ReactJS
			component and its associated CSS stylesheet in a subdirectory of a directory
			named	<code>components</code>. The <code>Example</code> component is located
			in the files <code>components/example/{Example.jsx,Example.css}</code>.
		</p>
			You should look through the files invoked in the getting-started.html view
			(<code>getting-started.html</code>, <code>gettingStarted.jsx</code>,
			<code>components/example/{Example.jsx</code>) since it shows the JavaScript
			and JSX statements needed to run an ReactJS web application along with
			explanatory comments. 	You should use this
			pattern and file naming convention for the other components you build for the class.
		</p>
		<p>
			Model data is typically fetched from the web server which retrieves the data from a database.
			To avoid having to setup a database for this project we will give you an HTML script tag
			to load the model data directly into the browser's DOM from the local file system.
			The models will appear in the DOM under the property name <code>cs142models</code>. You will be
			able to access it under the name <code>window.cs142models</code> in an ReactJS componment.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Problem 1: Understand and update the example view (5 points)</h3>
		<p>
			You should look through and understand the <code>getting-started.html</code> view
			and the <code>Example</code> component. To demonstrate your understanding do the
			following:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Update the model data for the Example component to use your name rather than "Unknown name".
				You should find where "Unknown name" is and replace it.
		  </li>
			<li>
				Replace the contents of the <code>div</code> region with the class <code>motto-update</code> in the
				Example component with some JSX statements that displays your name and a
				short (up to 20 characters) motto. Like the user's name, the initial value for
			  motto should come in with the model data. You must include some styling for this display
				in <code>Example.css</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Extend the display you did in the previous step so it allows the user to update the motto being
				displayed. The default value should continue to be retrived from the model data.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Problem 2: Create a new component - states view (10 points)</h3>
		<p>
			Create a new component view that will display the names of all states
			containing a given substring. Your view must implement an input field
			which accepts a substring. The view will display in
			alphabetical order a <strong>list</strong> of all states whose names contain the given substring
			(ignoring differences in case).  For example, the view for the substring of "al"
			should list the states Alabama, Alaska, and California. The page should also display the
			substring that was used to filter the states. If there are no
			matching states then the web page should display a message indicating
			that fact (rather than just showing nothing). All states should be displayed when the substring is empty.
		</p>
		<p>
			As in Problem #1 we provide you the model data with states.  It can
			be accessed via <code>window.cs142models.states</code> after it is included with:
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;script src="modelData/states.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			See <code>states.js</code> for a description of the format of the states data.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help you get started and guide you to the file naming conventions we
			want you to use we provided a file <code>p2.html</code> that will load
			and display the bundle <code>compiled/p2.bundle.js</code> which
			is generated by webpack from <code>p2.jsx</code> which displays
			the React component <code>States</code>.
			You can open this file in your browser via
			the URL <a href="http://localhost:3000/p2.html">http://localhost:3000/p2.html</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The files you will need to implement are:
			<ul>
				<li><code>components/states/States.jsx</code> - The ReactJS Component
				 of your states component.
			 </li>
			 <li>
					<code>components/states/States.css</code> - Any CSS styles your component
				 needs. <strong>You must include some styling for your state list here.</strong>
			  </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Problem 3: Personalizing the Layout (5 points)</h3>
		<p>
			Create a ReactJS component named <code>Header</code> that will display a personalized
			header at the top of a view. Add this header to all ReactJS
            web apps in your assignment (<code>gettingStarted.jsx</code>, <code>p2.jsx</code>,
            <code>p4.jsx</code>, <code>p5.jsx</code>).
						This header is in addition to the header from part 1 - do not
						replace that header.
            Use your imagination and creativity to
			create a header that is "uniquely you". This can include additional images,
			graphics, whatever you like.  You can extend the JSX/JavaScript in the
			components but you may not use external ReactJS Components or JavaScript
			libraries such as JQuery. Be creative!
		</p>
        <p>
            The files you will need to implement are:
			<ul>
				<li><code>components/header/Header.jsx</code> - The ReactJS Component
				 of your header component. This is defined a class Header of type
				 <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">React.Component</a>.
			 </li>
				<li><code>components/header/Header.css</code> - Any CSS styles your component
				needs. <strong>You must include some styling for your header here.</strong></li>
			</ul>
	    Note: <code>gettingStarted.jax</code> should have 2 headers: the
			personalized header from Problem 3 at he top of the page and the header
			with the motto from Problem 1.2 right below it. All other pages views
			(<code>p2.html</code>, <code>p4.html</code> and <code>p5.html</code>)
			should only have your personalized header from Problem 3.
        </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Problem 4: Add dynamic switching of the views (10 points)</h3>
		<p>
		Create a <code>p4.html</code> and a corresponding JSX file
    <code>p4.jsx</code>
		that includes both view components
		(the <code>Example</code> and <code>States</code>  components). The
		<code>p4.jsx</code> needs
		to implement an ability to switch between the display of the two components.
		When a view is displayed there should be a button above it that switches
		to display the other view.  For example, when the <code>States</code> view
		is displayed the button above it should read "Switch to Example," and when
		pushed the <code>States</code> should disappear and the <code>Example</code>
		view should be displayed.
		</p>
		<p>For this problem you will need to create the files above as well as
			modify the webpack configuration file <code>webpack.config.js</code>
			to build a file <code>compiled/p4.bundle.js</code> that you can
			uses in <code>p4.html</code> file. Note that if you are using Webpack with
			--watch (i.e. npm run build:w), you will need to restart it after
			changing code>webpack.config.js</code>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Problem 5: Single page app (5 points)</h3>
		<p>
		Although the approach taken in Problem 4 allows you to switch between
		the two views, it does not allow you to bookmark or share a URL pointing
		at a particular view.  Even doing a browser refresh event causes the app to
		lose track of which view was being displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
		We can address this deficiency by storing the view information into the URL.
		<a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">React Router</a> provides
		this functionality for ReactJS. For this problem make a
		copy of your <code>p4.html</code> solution into a file named <code>p5.html</code>
		and copy your <code>p4.jsx</code> into a file named <code>p5.jsx</code>.
		Convert the code to use <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">React Router</a>
		to switch between the two component views. You should have a <strong>styled toolbar-like
		control</strong> (simple plain text links are not sufficient)
		that will allow the user to switch between the example and states
		component views.
		</p>
		<p>
		Since this is the first extensions from the core ReactJS we import, we provide
		you with step-by-step instructions.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The project's <code>package.json</code> specifies react-router
				so the npm install command already fetched it for us. We do need
				to explicitly import it into our <code>p5.jsx</code> file. Add
				the following import line:
				<pre>import { HashRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";</pre>
				The line uses the JavaScript
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/importinport">
					import
				</a>
				statement to bring in the ReactJS components from React Router:
				<a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/HashRouter.md">
					HashRouter
				</a>,
				<a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/api/Route.md">
				  Route
				</a>, and
				<a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/Link.md">
					Link
				</a>.
				The HashRouter module of React Router uses the fragment portion of the URL
				for storing infomation. So we can make
			  <code>p5.html#/states</code> mark showing the States
				view while <code>p5.html#/example</code> specifies the Example component
				view.
			</li>
			<li>
			The most common way of using React Router is to conditially render
			the view we want based on the current URL.  It is
			the <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/api/Route.md">
				Route
			</a> component that implements this condition rendering when placed inside
			a HashRouter element like:
			<pre>
				&lt;HashRouter>
				  ...
					&lt;Route path="/states" component={States} />
			  	&lt;Route path="/example" component={Example} />
					...
				&lt;/HashRouter>
			</pre>
			which would render the States component if the URL had <code>#/states</code> and
			the Example component if the URL had <code>#/example</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
		  Although we could use hyperlinks (i.e. &lt;a tags) to switch views
			react router recommends using the Link component to generated the
			hyperlinks.
			<pre>
				&lt;Link to="/states">States&lt;/Link>
			</pre>
			generates a hyperlink with href="#/states" and the strings "States"
			in it.
			</li>
		</ol>

    <section>
    	<h3 class="left-border">Style (5 points)</h3>
		<p>
		These points will be awarded if your solutions have proper MVC decomposition and follow
		the style guidelines discussed in lecture and section. <strong>Note that you should not directly
    manipulate the DOM in your code.</strong>
		In addition, your code and templates must be clean and readable.
		Remember to run ESLint before submitting. ESHint should raise no errors.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3 class="left-border">Deliverables</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>After implementing part 5, make sure parts 1 through 4 still work!</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		Use the standard class <a href="submit.html">submission mechanism</a>
		to submit the entire application (everything in the <code>project4</code>
		directory).
