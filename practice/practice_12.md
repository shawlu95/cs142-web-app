#### Problem 2
JavaScript: [practice_12_p2.js](../sample_codes/practice_12_p2.js)

What is the sequence of event when user clicks D?

For each activated listener, what is the `target` and `currentTarget`?

#### Problem 3
JavaScript: [practice_12_p3.js](../sample_codes/practice_12_p3.js)

What is the sequence of event when user clicks D?
